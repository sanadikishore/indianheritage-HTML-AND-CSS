                    For generations, India has a prevailing tradition of the joint family system. It is when extended members of a family-parents, children, 
                    the children's spouses and their offspring, etc. - live together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head of the joint 
                    Indian family system. He mostly makes all important decisions and rules, and other family members are likely to abide by them.
